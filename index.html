            i received a job mid-course , and the subjects i learned were
            current if not more so , in the company i joined . i honestly feel i
            got every penny's.

            i was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp . i'v been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experoence here . i signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun ! enrolled shortly thereafter . the next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life . since
            completing the course , i'v successfully switched careers working as
            a software Engineer at a VR startUP

            >Before joining the bootcamp , i'v never written a line of code . i
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step . i was encoraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program . the entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint . they
            were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance . the
            agile team project , in particular , was outstanding , it took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have
            . in fact , i'v often referred to it during interviews as an example
            of my developent experience . it certainly helped me land a job as a
            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers 100%
            recommend!</q

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves .
            getting guidance from them and learning from their experience was
            easy.

          <q
            >the staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find
            really refreshing . the program gave me the confidence necessary to
            be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer . the standard is above the rest . you will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
            and amazing people</q
